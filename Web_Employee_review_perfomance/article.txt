<p><b>Project: Simple Employee Performance Evaluation System using PHP/MySQLi</b></p>

<h2><b>About The Project</b></h2>

<p>The <strong>Employee Performance Evaluation System</strong> is a simple project that can help a certain company evaluate the performance of their employees based on their task accomplishments. This system has 3 types of users which are the <strong>Admin, Employee, </strong>and <strong>Evaluator</strong>. The Admin Side is the system user that in-charge to manage the important data of the system such as the <strong>department, designation, employee list, and list of evaluators</strong>. The admin has access to all of the data stored and the database. The Employee side is the system users that can only access the tasks where they are assigned and submit their progress. The submitted progress of the employee in each task will be the reference of the evaluators on how they will rate the employees. The Evaluator side is the system user side that evaluates the performance of the employees' every task. They will evaluate the employees' by their <strong>efficiency, timeliness, quality, and employees' accuracy to accomplish</strong> a certain task.</p>

<h2><b>How the System Works</b></h2>

<p>The <strong>Employee Performance Evaluation System</strong> users can be only created by admin users. The first thing that the admin should do in the system is to populate the department, designation, and the evaluators' list. After that, they will store the details of the employees and along with the employees' system credentials. Then, the admin will create a task and assigned this to an employee. When the employee has already assigned a task, the employee will log in to the system each time they have progressed for a certain task and submit their progress details to store in the system database. When the employee finally completed the task they must check the <strong>"Task Completed"</strong> check box so that the evaluator can start to evaluate their accomplishment and rate their performance. After the employee marks the task assigned to them as <strong>"Completed Task"</strong>, the evaluator can now begin to evaluate the performance of the employee.</p>
