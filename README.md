# Romoaldo_Case_study_development
Hello guys,

To develop this two project I have used this technology and framework:

<b>Laravel (PHP), MySQL, JS, CSS, Bootstrap, AdminLTE, Apache Server </b> <br>
To run the first project inside the folder Web_employee_perfomance first create a database with this name "epes_db" after that import the database in the same folder then copy the whole folder into your local server make sure your database.php configurations its okay according to your server username and password. <br>

2. The second project for KYC update data is in Laravel the process for database is the same just make sure the name of your database is the same as in your.env file.
3. Then run php artisan key:generate
4. php artisan serve
5. enjoy
